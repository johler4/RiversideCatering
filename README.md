# RiversideCatering
First (real world) front-end project.
My second job's website needs updating, why not let me do it?
Old site:
https://www.riversidecateringandmarket.com/

Goals:
- Learn SDLC
- Build a complete website
- Improve knowledge CSS, HTML, and JavaScript

First things first, SDLC:
- Researched SDLC and found that there are typically 7 steps in a software development lifecycle: Planning, Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Implementation and Maintenance.
  1) Planning: In this step, if we have an existing system, we define the problem and scope of our existing system. We then define the objective for our new system(s). This stage would also include a project schedule and budget if those items need addressing (in this case they do not).
  2) Analysis: During this step we gather specific detials about the requirements for our new system and incorporate more specific data. This can include the first system prototype drafts, market research, and an evaluation of competitors.
  3) Design: This step can significantly eliminate the time needed to develop the software. At this stage outline: the system interface, databases, core software features, user interface and usability, and networking requirements.
  4) Development: Start writing code! This stage includes both front and back-end development. This stage is often split into separate sub-stages, depending on system layout/requirements.
  5) Testing: Test the application's features to ensure they work correctly and coherently and fulfill user objectives and expectations. This process involves detecting possibly bugs, defects, and errors, as well as searching for vulnerabilities.
  6) Implementation: Make the product available to its end users. Deploy the system!
  7) Maintenance: As needed. Fix bugs, make updates/improvements as necessary.
