# RiversideCatering
First (real world) front-end project.
My second job's website needs updating, why not let me do it?
Old site:
https://www.riversidecateringandmarket.com/

**Goals:**
- Learn SDLC
- Build a complete website
- Improve knowledge CSS, HTML, and JavaScript
  - Includes learning how to create a working 'contact us' form
- Improve mobile friendly programming
- Possibly learn how to implement/deploy a website to the actual WWW

**First things first, SDLC:**
- Researched SDLC and found that there are typically 7 steps in a software development lifecycle: Planning, Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Implementation and Maintenance.
  1) **Planning**: In this step we define the problem(s) and scope of our existing system. We then define the objective/goals for our new system. This stage would also include a project schedule and budget if those items need addressing (in this case they do not).
  2) **Analysis**: During this step we gather specific detials about the requirements for our new system and incorporate more specific data. This can include the first system prototype drafts, market research, and an evaluation of competitors.
  3) **Design**: This step can significantly eliminate the time needed to develop the software. At this stage outline: the system interface, databases, core software features, user interface and usability, and networking requirements.
  4) **Development**: Start writing code! This stage includes both front and back-end development. This stage is often split into separate sub-stages, depending on system layout/requirements.
  5) **Testing**: Test the application's features to ensure they work correctly and coherently and fulfill user objectives and expectations. This process involves detecting possibly bugs, defects, and errors, as well as searching for vulnerabilities.
  6) **Implementation**: Make the product available to its end users. Deploy the system!
  7) **Maintenance**: As needed. Fix bugs, make updates/improvements as necessary.

**Second, layout project's SDLC:**
1) Planning:
  1) Problem(s) of existing website:
     - Styling: color scheme, layout, fonts, images
     - Lack of CTA (call to action)
     - Menu not viewable directly on site, must download a .pdf file
  2) Schedule/budget - n/a
2) Analysis:
   1)Details about requirements for new system:
      - Owner asked for styling to be modern, minimalistic and classy.
      - Colors: black/white/greys. Also wants to incorporate a 'slate blue' color and the font that is on his business cards for the company name.
      - CTA (contact us button) needs to attract more attention
      - List menu items on site (include .pdf file still?)
      - Better quality photos
      - Coding will be all HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
   2) Market research/evaluation of competitors:
      - Looked at other local catering companies/restaurants (their website definitely look better than what's existing)
      - Other n/a
3) Design:
   1) Starting from scratch... ditching the entire prior website. Will take elements of information/photos from it.
   2) Start with skeleton design of each page. Line chart of linked pages.
   3) Resarched website designs and found a few simplistic, modern designs that I like.
   4) Found a good 'slate blue' color (#2b4257). Other colors will be black/white/greys. May incorporate some off-whites to soften the stark look of just white. Unsure of what colors will go where.
   5) Have some photos from existing website of staff/business license. Also some photos of food from various jobs. Need to find other photos for possible backgrounds/accent/stock photos.
      - Found a website to search for *free* high quality photos: unsplash.com
   6) Single main page with linked branches: about us, menu. (website is just for catering, not much to it.
   7) Mobile friendly!!!! Current site is mobile friendly, but still doesn't look great.
4) Development:
   - Start coding! Start with HTML elements,
5) Testing:
   1) Not much to testing for a simple webpage. Right?
      - Check for typos
      - Check for sizing on various devices
      - Check links
      - Check 'contact us' button
6) Implementation:
   - Need to get with owners' to obtain approval of final design.
   - Need to get with their current website person/company to see what we need to do there?
   - Possibly need deploy website under new URL (and server?).
7) Maintenance:
   - I don't expect much maintenance being necesarry for a simple web page, but you never know..
  
**Third, get to work!**
